# Ice-Cream
Soufiane El kabil
Using Finite Difference Equation along with Maple and Fortran90, find the solution to the Schrödinger equation for an electron that is moving through Ice-cream.
Then we approach the calculations and interpretations of the properties of the
electron without and with impurity, confined in an ice-cream quantum box (Quantum
dots). Using the solution of the Schrödinger equation by the finite difference method,
in order to determine the effect of quantum confinement on the total energy and the
binding energy. All calculations are done numerically by a simulation software known as
Maple, which will help us to draw all the graphs appearing in this Project.

The simulation is done too by fortran 90, to compary the results between two codes
